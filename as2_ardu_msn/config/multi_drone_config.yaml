# Multi-Drone Survey Mission Configuration
# This file configures both survey parameters and swarm behavior

# Swarm Configuration

  drone_spacing: 5.0               # Spacing between drones in meters (for parallel mode)
  synchronized: false              # true = all fly together, false = sequential
  
  # Individual drone configurations (optional overrides)
  drones:

# Survey Parameters (shared by all drones)
